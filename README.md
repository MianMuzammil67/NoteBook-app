# Notes Application
This is a simple Notes Application built using MVVM architecture, LiveData, Room database, and RecyclerView.

# Introduction
The Notes Application allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes on their Android devices. It uses the MVVM architecture, which separates the application logic into three layers: the View, ViewModel, and Model. LiveData is used for observing data changes, Room database for storing and retrieving notes, and RecyclerView for displaying the notes in a list.

# Key Features
* Create, read, update, and delete notes
* MVVM architecture for separation of concerns
* LiveData for observing data changes
* Room database for storing and retrieving notes
* RecyclerView for displaying notes in a list
# Requirements
* Android Studio 4.1.1 or higher
* Android SDK 21 or higher
# Getting Started
To get started with the Notes Application, simply clone the repository and open the project in Android Studio. Build and run the application on an emulator or a physical device running Android SDK 21 or higher.

<!-- How to Use
Upon launching the application, users will be presented with a list of their saved notes. They can add a new note by tapping the floating action button at the bottom right corner of the screen. Users can edit an existing note by tapping on it in the list, which will open the note in a detail screen. In the detail screen, users can make changes to the note and save them by tapping the save button. Users can also delete a note by swiping it left or right in the list. -->
